# 🌱 FarmTrust – Transparent Eco-Labelling for Agricultural Products

FarmTrust is a lightweight and scalable eco-labelling system for agricultural products, built on the principles of ISO 14021 (self-declared environmental claims) and ISO 14024 (third-party environmental labelling). The platform enables farmers and certification bodies to declare, verify, and record environmental attributes of agricultural goods on a blockchain—ensuring authenticity, traceability, and consumer trust.

## 🧩 Project Structure

FarmTrust is organized as a modular system, consisting of three main repositories:

### 🔸Frontend
A web interface for farmers, certifiers, and consumers.

### 🔸 Backend 
REST API that handles data validation, user management, and blockchain interaction.

### 🔸 Smart Contracts  
Smart contracts for managing eco-label declarations and verifications on-chain.

## 🌍 Purpose
🔸 Enable farmers to declare environmental attributes of their products.

🔸 Allow certification bodies to validate and certify those attributes.

🔸 Give consumers transparent access to trusted environmental claims.


## 🔒 Key Features

🔸 Blockchain-based traceability

🔸 Public access to product environmental claims

🔸 QR code integration for easy data lookup
